# Management of Common Inpatient Problems

## Abnormal Vitals

### Fever (High Temp)

Fever could be associated with a pre-existing medical issue, or a newly-acquired or iatrogenic issue. Consider patient's recent history & physical findings in new-onset fever. For example, did they undergo any procedures, like drainage of a septic abscess?

#### Differential

- **Infection (bacterial/viral)**
  - **Related to catheter, IV (i.e. thrombophlebitis), foley, or other drain**
  - **Surgical site infections**
  - **Hospital-acquired pneumonia**
  - **C. diff diarrhea (esp. if antibiotic hx)**
  - **Infected bed sores**
- Autoimmune conditions
- Malignancy (often diagnosis of exclusion)
- Drugs (generally diagnosis of exclusion)
- **Thromboembolus**
- **Benign post-op fever - common and not cause for alarm**
- Intracranial hemorrhage
- Vasculitis
- **Abdominal processes**
  - **Pancreatitis**
  - **Acalculous cholecystitis**
- Thyrotoxicosis
- Transfusion reaction

#### Things to ask when called

- Other vital signs
  - Low BP is a warning sign for sepsis - typically sBP < 90, but depends on patient's baseline.
  - Usually tachycardic. Fever & bradycardia is potentially worrying for high ICP (Cushing's triad).
  - Might be slightly tachypneic. Respiratory distress is highly concerning.
- Details of surgical or procedural interventions
- Associated areas of pain

#### Investigations

- **Blood cultures:** If T > 38.3 with suspected infectious origin.
- **Urine dipstick & cultures:** If suspected UTI.
- **Lumbar puncture:** If suspecting meningitis. Caution if ICP high or coagulopathic.

#### Complications

- Increased metabolic demand
  - Aggravation of existing cardiopulmonary insufficiency

#### Treatment

***Suspected infection***

For most, monitor & treat underlying issue. Elevated temperature is a normal part of the antimicrobial response. The patient can be educated about this if necessary. Small towels soaked in cool water and wrung dry can be helpful for symptomatic relief.

If concerned about a bad infection, can monitor more aggressively:

```
Vitals Q2H - notify if sBP < 90 or saturation < 90
Blood cultures now (if suspected bacteremia)
Urine cultures now (if suspected UTI)
Acetaminophen 1g PO q4h PRN
Antibiotics (if suspected infection)
```

Aspirin & NSAIDs also help lower fever, but cause more unwanted side effects on platelets & GI tract. Acetaminophen & aspirin can be combined for greater effect.

For patients who cannot receive drugs PO, can give a parenteral or suppository of NSAIDs.

***CNS disease or trauma***

It is more important to treat fever in these patients to minimize ill effects of high temperature on the brain.

### Tachycardia (High HR)

#### Differential

- Associated with fever (see section in Fever)
- Acidosis
  - Secondary to hypoxia (see section on Hypoxia)
  - Diabetic ketoacidosis
  - Lactic acidosis
- Hypotension / shock (see section on Hypotension)
- Cardiogenic (i.e. arrhythmias, ischemia, MI, heart failure)
- Sympathetic response to pain or other stress
- Anxiety disorder / panic attack
- Drug exposure (stimulants, anticholinergics)
- Drug withdrawal (i.e. beta blocker withdrawal)
- Endocrine (hyperthyroid, pheochromocytoma, etc.)

### Bradycardia (Low HR)

### Hypertension (High BP)

### Hypotension (Low BP)

#### Differential

- Orthostatic / postural hypotension
- Shock (cellular & tissue hypoxia due to &darr; Oxygen delivery/uptake or &uarr; oxygen consumption)
  - Distributive
    - Septic shock / SIRS
    - Neurogenic shock
    - Anaphylactic shock
    - Toxic shock
  - Cardiogenic
  - Hypovolemic
  - Obstructive
